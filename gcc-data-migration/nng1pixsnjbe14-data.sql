Space agencies are implementing or planning different space missions to meet this observation requirement, including NASA\u2019s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission. GEDI has been collecting high-resolution 3D lidar observations and provide spatially dense samplings of vertical forest structure at the global scale. Here we present an overview of theoretical background and algorithm developments of GEDI Level 2B canopy cover and vertical profile metrics product. We implement the algorithm over waveforms simulated from airborne lidar point clouds and GEDI\u2019s airborne prototype Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS), generating GEDI L2B equivalent products such as canopy fractional cover, plant area index (PAI), and as well as their vertical profiles. Sensitivity analysis and comparison with terrestrial lidar demonstrate a high efficacy of the algorithm in accurately estimating these variables even over dense tropical rainforests. Yet these results also suggest a relatively larger retrieval uncertainty from understory level (i.e. 0-5 m in height) and an optimal vertical profile resolution of 5 m by taking the trade-off between estimation accuracy and vertical resolution. While algorithm presented in this paper forms the basis for initial GEDI data product releases, it will be continuously refined and updated as GEDI extends its data collection and post-launch validation process.", "plain_summary": "", "key_points": "Implementation of GEDI L2B algorithms shows a high degree of consistence in both simulated and real waveforms\nRelatively larger retrieval uncertainty of canopy profile is expected in the understory layer\nTrade-off between estimation accuracy and vertical resolution suggests an optimal vertical profile resolution at 5 m", "version_description": {"children": [{"type": "p", "children": [{"text": ""}]}]}, "introduction": {"children": [{"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a geodetic-class, full-waveform light detection and ranging (lidar) laser system installed on the International Space Station "}, {"type": "ref", "children": [{"text": ""}], "refId": "1f248f85"}, {"text": ". GEDI responds directly to observational priorities set by the National Academy of Sciences and NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, which emphasizes the need for lidar vertical structure measurements to address key challenges in carbon cycling and biodiversity.

It aims to provide both (1) a general theoretical overview of the algorithms, processing steps and procedures required to provide measurements of canopy profile metrics and (2) a detailed algorithm implementation and processing flow specifically designed for the GEDI mission L2B products.

An off-nadir angle of discrete return airborne lidar is typically < 15\u00b0 and it is < 6\u00b0 for GEDI to avoid inaccurate range measurements. While airborne lidar can help delineate individual tree crown with high spatial resolution and footprint density (i.e. counting small openings as part of tree cover), large footprint waveform lidar systems like GEDI can only provide estimates of canopy fractional cover over the laser-illuminated area. Thus, the GEDI derived canopy cover is the percent of the ground covered by the vertical projection of canopy material (i.e. leaves, branches and stems only). It is different from two other widely used cover types: canopy closure defined as \"the proportion of the vegetation over a segment of the sky hemisphere at one point on the ground\u201d, or crown cover as \"the percentage of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the outermost perimeter of the natural spread of the foliage of plants\" "}, {"type": "ref", "children": [{"text": ""}], "refId": "06595956"}, {"text": ".

Here we did not focus on determination of the precise ground elevation in a waveform, a problem more pronounced with relatively large footprints due to a slope effect (e.g. ~65 m ICESat-1 footprint) but a relatively minor one for smaller footprints like LVIS or GEDI. Instead, much of our efforts were focused on improving conventional methods (e.g. Gaussian decomposition) for a better separation of canopy and ground energy using independently calculated ground elevation as an input (e.g. from LVIS or GEDI L2A product). Results in this study presented a high degree of consistency among these algorithms, adding extra robustness in processing data collected at imperfect acquisition conditions that can frequently occur during mission operations (e.g. atmospheric contamination and instrument idiosyncrasies). For example, the exGaussian fitting, a method widely used in chromatographic analysis, can provide an explicit mathematical solution to estimate asymmetrical normal distribution in a skewed waveform. This theoretical model, under minor assumptions, can improve the accuracy and efficiency of ground energy fitting in a return waveform using pre-determined boundary constraints. It is also of great value and interest to continue algorithm test for processing similar non-Gaussian waveforms that occurs in GEDI or other future instruments. Should this main algorithm fail, our backup solution with the match-filter was able to provide almost identical estimates at the expense of vertical resolution. Yet it slightly overestimated understory contribution when compared with the exGaussian method. Integration over a coarser vertical resolution (e.g. 5 m or 10 m) could drastically reduce their difference in PAVD estimates (Fig. 6 D & F). Also, it had a minimal impact on the estimate of total canopy cover (Fig. 7). However, neither method could fully separate canopy component from ground returns particularly at the lowest height range (0 ~ 2 m), as shown in our sensitivity analysis using synthetic zero-pulse-width waveforms (Fig. 8). The difficulty of a precise separation partly arose from the long laser pulse width, but may also be caused by the non-flatness and terrain complexity in a 25 m plot where understory and ground usually overlapped to some extent along the vertical direction. Anticipating other environmental uncertainties such as topographic relief, we generated and recommend the use of GEDI profile products at 5 m vertical resolution for higher measurement accuracy particularly at the understory layer in a dense canopy.

Such examination was important because we expected greater errors from LVIS and GEDI at this range caused by algorithm uncertainty and/or occlusion effect of the downward-viewing geometry. By contrast, terrestrial lidar could provide better estimates here with its upward-viewing configuration, although it might not be able to provide accurate estimates at high strata (e.g. > 30 m in height) due to signal attenuation and occlusion effect in a dense canopy. Not surprisingly, the largest difference between TLS and LVIS took place at a higher vertical resolution (i.e. 1 m) but was effectively mitigated when using a coarser resolution (e.g. 5 m). Our results were in line with simulation analysis on the preceding ground finding uncertainty, supporting our hypothesis of the accuracy-resolution trade off and the choice of 5m as an optimal value for GEDI.

These simulated TB\u2019s then serve as both a training set and a test set for the algorithms. We have tested this simulation methodology by developing algorithms for SSM/I. These SSM/I algorithms are then tested using actual measurements. The results show that the SSM/I algorithms coming from the RTM simulation have essentially the same performance as those developed directly from SSM/I measurements. These results are not surprising since the RTM was calibrated to reproduce the SSM/I TB\u2019s. This exercise is more of a closure verification of the techniques being used. Simulation results for the AMSR retrieval algorithm are given in Section 3."}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Algorithm Development Plan", "bold": true}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Figure 1 shows the basic steps in developing the AMSR ocean algorithm.

We expect even better performance from AMSR because of the additional 6.9 GHz channel, which provides TS sensitivity in cold water. One concern is the variation of the 6.9 and 10.7-GHz TB with wind direction.

Therefore, HLS does not adjust the geolocation of Sentinel-2 data of this period.

The GEDI04_A algorithm uses GEDI Level-2A (GEDI02_A) relative height metrics as input to parametric linear models to predict AGBD. GEDI04_A models were developed from a quality-filtered data set of GEDI footprint-sized field plots paired with simulated GEDI waveforms across 21 countries and all continents within the GEDI domain (51.6 degrees N \u2013 S latitude).

This uncertainty limits our understanding of carbon-cycle feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. The causes of this uncertainty are inconsistent measurement techniques and the use of Earth-observation methods that were not designed to quantify carbon density. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) can overcome these challenges by producing measurements of vegetation height and structure using a lidar sensor on the International Space Station. This document describes methods developed by the GEDI Science Team to convert spaceborne measurements of vegetation height and structure into units of aboveground biomass density. The algorithms depend on geographic world region and the type of vegetation that is present. For example, evergreen broadleaf forests of the humid tropics in South America use a different algorithm from temperate broadleaf forests of Europe.

These 7 cases represent two EBT strata, two DBT strata, and three DNT strata. In the EBT prediction stratum within Europe and North America we use the corresponding DBT by world region models. We assume that models trained using data from DBT in the northern-latitude temperate zone will perform better in these prediction strata than models developed using EBT data. In the current version of the filtered FSBD, EBT samples are exclusively tropical or within the Australia and Oceania world region, and thus not representative of EBT in North America or Europe. In the DBT stratum within the South America world region and the Australia and Oceania world region, we use the corresponding EBT model for the associated world region. In the Australia and Oceania world region, we assume the DBT classification is an error in MCD12Q1, because Australia lacks forests and woodlands dominated by deciduous overstorey trees. In the South America world region, DBT forests are likely to be tropical moist or dry forests that are more similar in form to EBT of South America than to DBT of other world regions. Finally, we lack training data in DNT globally. We use a corresponding ENT by world region model for three of these strata (Australia and Oceania, Europe, and North America), however in Australia and Oceania DNT are extremely rare and likely represent an error in MCD12Q1.
