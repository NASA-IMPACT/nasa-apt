The Earth-emitted radiance is a function of temperature and emissivity and gets attenuated by the atmosphere on its path to the satellite. The atmosphere also emits radiation, some of which reaches the sensor directly as “path radiance,” while some gets radiated to the surface (irradiance) and reflected back to the sensor, commonly known as the reflected downwelling sky irradiance.

Determining the separate contribution from each component in a radiometric measurement is an ill-posed problem since there will always be more unknowns—N emissivities and a single temperature—than the number of measurements, N, available. For MODIS, we will be solving for one temperature and three emissivities (MODIS TIR bands 29, 31, and 32). To solve the ill-posed problem, an additional constraint is needed, independent of the data. There have been numerous theories and approaches over the past two decades to solve for this extra degree of freedom. For example, the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Working Group (TEWG) analyzed ten different algorithms for solving the problem (Gillespie et al. 1999). Most of these relied on a radiative transfer model to correct at-sensor radiance to surface radiance and an emissivity model to separate temperature and emissivity. Other approaches include the SW algorithm, which extends the sea-surface temperature (SST) SW approach to land surfaces, assuming that land emissivities in the window region (10.5–12 µm) are stable and well known. However, this assumption leads to unreasonably large errors over barren regions where emissivities have large variations both spatially and spectrally.

In Figure 1 (top), pixels with significant surface effects tend to cluster as a cloud of points (labeled C) away from the 100% ice concentration line A-B resulting in an underestimate of ice concentration by the NT algorithm. The use of horizontally polarized channels makes it imperative to resolve a third ice type to overcome the difficulty of surface effects on the emissivity of the horizontally polarized component of the brightness temperature.","marks":[]}]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"We make use of GR(89V19V) and GR(89H19H) to resolve the ambiguity between pixels with true low ice concentration and pixels with significant surface effects. A plot of these two ratios are found to form narrow clusters except for areas where surface effects decrease TB(19H) and consequently increase GR(89H19H) (Figure 1 (bottom)). Values of high GR(89V19V ) and high GR(89H19H) are indicative of open water. The range of GR(89H19H) values is larger because of the greater dynamic range between ice and water for the horizontally polarized components. With increasing ice concentration, the two ratios have more similar values. The narrow cluster of pixels adjacent to the diagonal shown in Figure 1 (bottom) represents 100% ice concentration with different GR values corresponding to different ice types. When surface effects come into play, points deviate from this narrow cluster towards increased GR(89H19H) values (cloud of points to the right of the diagonal) while GR(89V19V ) changes little or remains constant. This cloud of points labeled C in Figure 3 (bottom) also corresponds to the cluster of points labeled C in Figure 3 (top). The difference, therefore, between these two GRs (ΔGR) is used as a measure of the magnitude of surface effects. Based on this analysis we introduce a new ice type C, which represents ice having significant surface effects. For computational reasons we rotate the axes in PR-GR space (Figure 1 (top)) by an angle φ so the A-B line is vertical. This makes the rotated PRs (PRR(19) and PRR(89)) independent of ice types A and B (first-year and multiyear for the Arctic). The use of the 89 GHz data requires a correction for atmospheric effects.

For example, the cluster of open water values is mainly the result of changing atmospheric conditions. The modeled atmospheres adequately span the lengths of the OW clusters.

Multiple definitions of canopy cover exist, depending on the applied measuring techniques (Fiala et al. 2006; Hansen et al. 2002; Hansen et al. 2003; Jennings et al. 1999; Korhonen et al. 2011; Rautiainen et al. 2005). The central issues in the definition are (1) whether the measurement is acquired at a specific viewing angle (mostly near-nadir) or over the entire hemisphere; and (2) whether a tree crown is treated as an opaque object including all small within-canopy gaps. In contrast to traditional passive optical sensors, lidar systems measure the forest mostly at a small zenith-viewing angle. An off-nadir angle of discrete return airborne lidar is typically < 15° and it is < 6° for GEDI to avoid inaccurate range measurements. While airborne lidar can help delineate individual tree crown with high spatial resolution and footprint density (i.e. counting small openings as part of tree cover), large footprint waveform lidar systems like GEDI can only provide estimates of canopy fractional cover over the laser-illuminated area. Thus, the GEDI derived canopy cover is the percent of the ground covered by the vertical projection of canopy material (i.e. leaves, branches and stems only). It is different from two other widely used cover types: canopy closure defined as \\"the proportion of the vegetation over a segment of the sky hemisphere at one point on the ground”, or crown cover as \\"the percentage of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the outermost perimeter of the natural spread of the foliage of plants\\"(Jennings et al. 1999).

It is typically utilized in the majority of ecological, hydrological and climate models to describe interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere (Myneni et al. 2002; Weiss et al. 2007). A closely related concept is plant area index (PAI) that incorporates all canopy structural elements (e.g. branch and trunk) in addition to leaves, and their numeric difference is usually small in dense broadleaf forests (e.g. LAI ≈ 93% PAI) (Tang et al. 2012). In this ATBD, we do not explicitly differentiate these two and use them equivalently hereafter for simplicity. Vertical LAI profile is the vertical variation of LAI closely related to foliage-height profiles (Aber 1979; Parker et al. 1989). It is a more realistic representation of three-dimensional canopy structure that can be used to quantify flows of energy and material in ecosystems (Vose et al. 1995; Ellsworth & Reich 1993; Parker et al. 2005; Stark et al. 2012). It can also be used to describe growth pattern of forests at different succession stages (Parker 2004). Different lidar systems, including terrestrial, airborne and spaceborne sensors, have demonstrated their capacity in deriving highly accurate LAI and profile products even in extremely dense forests (Armston et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2012; Hancock et al. 2014; Strahler et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2012; Tang, Brolly, et al. 2014; F. Zhao et al. 2011; K. Zhao et al. 2011; Morsdorf et al. 2006). However, large-footprint lidar systems cannot directly measure leaf clumping conditions or leaf angle distributions. Ancillary information (e.g. clumping index from multi-angle observations) is required to convert lidar-perceived effective LAI into true LAI (Chen & Black 1992; Chen et al. 2005; Pisek et al. 2015). Yet there is no such database available globally at GEDI’s footprint scale (~25 m). In consideration of the aforementioned limitations, GEDI only aims to derive PAI and its vertical profile as a more direct and accurate product. The users are recommended applying conversions based on their best knowledge to convert GEDI’s PAI to LAI for running earth system models (Myneni et al. 2002; Weiss et al. 2007). \\r","marks":[]}]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"FHD measures the complexity of canopy structure.

A high FHD value in forest ecology often results from more complex forests structure (e.g. caused by multiple canopy layers) (James & Wamer 1982; Bergen et al. 2009). This complexity is a good indicator of habitat quality for wild life, as suggested by pioneering studies of MacArthur & Horn (1961). In particular, biodiversity patterns of birds are widely studied in the context of vegetation structure (Clawges et al. 2008; Vierling et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2014; Swatantran et al. 2012; Goetz et al. 2007; Goetz et al. 2010; Goetz et al. 2014).

In the ecological literature, several key metrics describe three-dimensional distribution and complexity of the vegetation structure. Of particular importance are total canopy cover and its vertical profile, leaf area index (LAI) or plant area index (PAI) and its vertical profile, as well as foliage height diversity (FHD). Accurate estimates of these variables are of critical importance in studies of global environmental change and terrestrial biodiversity. Tremendous efforts from the remote sensing community have resulted in vegetation structure products at different spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g. ~10 m to 10 km, daily to annually) since the 1980s, primarily using data collected from passive optical remote sensing platforms. To date there have been a large number of regional to global scale canopy cover and LAI data sets available, including MODIS (Myneni et al. 2002; Defries et al. 2000), Landsat (Ganguly et al. 2008; Hansen et al. 2013; Sexton et al. 2013) and many others (Weiss et al. 2007).

However, further ecological applications of ICESat-derived products are still subject to limited data coverage and they are not optimized for forest-related studies. This is because ICESat is primarily designed to monitor ice dynamics in polar regions, resulting in sparsely distributed footprints over major forests at mid-low latitude (Abshire et al. 2005).
