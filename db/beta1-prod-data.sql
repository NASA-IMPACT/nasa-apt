GEDI responds directly to observational priorities set by the National Academy of Sciences and NASA\\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, which emphasizes the need for lidar vertical structure measurements to address key challenges in carbon cycling and biodiversity. The algorithm specified in this document is designed to derive GEDI L2B footprint level canopy cover and vertical profile over vegetated areas between ~52\\u00b0N and ~52\\u00b0S. It aims to provide both (1) a general theoretical overview of the algorithms, processing steps and procedures required to provide measurements of canopy profile metrics and (2) a detailed algorithm implementation and processing flow specifically designed for the GEDI mission L2B products. The data product includes estimates of total canopy cover and Plant Area Index (PAI), vertical profiles of canopy cover and PAI, the vertical profile of Plant Area Volume Density (PAVD) and foliage height diversity (FHD). "}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Canopy cover is a biophysical parameter widely used in terrestrial remote sensing to describe the spatially aggregated geometric properties of vegetation. Multiple definitions of canopy cover exist, depending on the applied measuring techniques refrefrefrefref. The central issues in the definition are (1) whether the measurement is acquired at a specific viewing angle (mostly near-nadir) or over the entire hemisphere; and (2) whether a tree crown is treated as an opaque object including all small within-canopy gaps. In contrast to traditional passive optical sensors, lidar systems measure the forest mostly at a small zenith-viewing angle. An off-nadir angle of discrete return airborne lidar is typically < 15\\u00b0 and it is < 6\\u00b0 for GEDI to avoid inaccurate range measurements. While airborne lidar can help delineate individual tree crown with high spatial resolution and footprint density (i.e. counting small openings as part of tree cover), large footprint waveform lidar systems like GEDI can only provide estimates of canopy fractional cover over the laser-illuminated area. Thus, the GEDI derived canopy cover is the percent of the ground covered by the vertical projection of canopy material (i.e. leaves, branches and stems only). It is different from two other widely used cover types: canopy closure defined as \\"the proportion of the vegetation over a segment of the sky hemisphere at one point on the ground\\u201d, or crown cover as \\"the percentage of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the outermost perimeter of the natural spread of the foliage of plants\\" ref. The canopy cover profile is the horizontally-intercepted canopy elements at a given height, and is calculated as one minus gap distribution at that height level."}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Leaf Area Index (LAI) is defined as one half of the total leaf area per unit ground surface refref and is closely linked to canopy cover through the gap distribution within canopy. It is typically utilized in the majority of ecological, hydrological and climate models to describe interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere ref ref. A closely related concept is PAI that incorporates all canopy structural elements (e.g. branch and trunk) in addition to leaves, and their numeric difference is usually small in dense broadleaf forests (e.g. LAI \\u2248 93% PAI) ref. In this ATBD, we do not explicitly differentiate these two and use them equivalently hereafter for simplicity. Vertical LAI profile is the vertical variation of LAI closely related to foliage-height profiles ref ref. It is a more realistic representation of three-dimensional canopy structure that can be used to quantify flows of energy and material in ecosystems refrefrefref. It can also be used to describe growth pattern of forests at different succession stages ref. Different lidar systems, including terrestrial, airborne and spaceborne sensors, have demonstrated their capacity in deriving highly accurate LAI and profile products even in extremely dense forests Arefrefrefrefrefrefrefref. However, large-footprint lidar systems cannot directly measure leaf clumping conditions or leaf angle distributions. Ancillary information (e.g. clumping index from multi-angle observations) is required to convert lidar-perceived effective LAI into true LAI refrefref. Yet there is no such database available globally at GEDI\\u2019s footprint scale (~25 m). In consideration of the aforementioned limitations, GEDI only aims to derive PAI and its vertical profile as a more direct and accurate product. The users are recommended applying conversions based on their best knowledge to convert GEDI\\u2019s PAI to LAI for running earth system modelsref ref. "}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "FHD measures structural complexity of forest canopy. It is also known as Shannon's diversity index, the Shannon-Wiener index, or the Shannon entropy in the ecological literature, and it was originally proposed to quantify the entropy (uncertainty or information level) in information theory ref. A high FHD value in forest ecology often results from more complex forests structure (e.g. caused by multiple canopy layers) ref ref. This complexity is a good indicator of habitat quality for wild life, as suggested by pioneering studies of ref. In particular, biodiversity patterns of birds are widely studied in the context of vegetation structure refrefrefref. Similar relationships apply among other taxa as well refrefref. Recent developments of lidar remote sensing have promised an enhanced measurement capability of FHD that was previously limited at a few plot samplings due to high labor cost. Since FHD measurement is largely based on estimates of vertical LAI profile, it can also be directly derived from GEDI."}]}]}, "historical_perspective": {"children": [{"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Vegetation structure, defined as the aboveground spatial arrangement of individual plant crowns, is closely linked to forest ecological functions and services. In the ecological literature, several key metrics describe three-dimensional distribution and complexity of the vegetation structure. Of particular importance are total canopy cover and its vertical profile, LAI (or PAI) and its vertical profile, as well as foliage height diversity. Accurate estimates of these variables are of critical importance in studies of global environmental change and terrestrial biodiversity. Tremendous efforts from the remote sensing community have resulted in vegetation structure products at different spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g. ~10 m to 10 km, daily to annually) since the 1980s, primarily using data collected from passive optical remote sensing platforms. To date there have been a large number of regional to global scale canopy cover and LAI data sets available, including MODIS refref, Landsat refrefref and many others ref. These products have been widely used in studies of terrestrial ecosystems and have greatly improved our knowledge and understanding of global environment and biodiversity change refrefrefrefrefref. However, three key issues remain unresolved: first, spectral signals of satellite images saturate over densely forested areas refref; second, products derived from different sensors (or even from the same sensor) are inconsistent refrefrefrefref; and finally, measurements of vertical canopy structure are largely unavailable. "}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Lidar remote sensing offers a potential solution to these problems by providing precise measurements of three-dimensional forest structure refrefref. Both plot-level and landscape-scale products of canopy cover, LAI and their profiles have been derived from terrestrial laser scanning and airborne discrete return or waveform lidar refrefrefrefrefrefrefrefrefrefrefrefref. These products cover all major biomes including dense tropical rainforests, and achieve high agreements with radiation-interception based techniques (e.g. LAI-2000 and hemispherical photons) and destructively sampled data. Attempts have also been made to generate similar data sets but over much broader geographical areas using data from spaceborne waveform lidar systems, such as ICESat refrefrefrefrefref. However, further ecological applications of ICESat-derived products are still subject to limited data coverage and they are not optimized for forest-related studies. This is because ICESat is primarily designed to monitor ice dynamics in polar regions, resulting in sparsely distributed footprints over major forests at mid-low latitude ref. The large footprint size of ICESat (~70 m in diameter) can introduce substantial measurement uncertainty of canopy structure, particularly over steep slopes refref. Yet no other canopy profile product exists globally. "}]}, {"type": "p", "children": [{"text": "Several lidar satellite missions have been proposed before GEDI, aiming to obtain reliable measurements of canopy profile metrics globally. These include the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission and the Deformation, Ecosystem Structure, and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) mission. However, these missions did not get launched because of several issues in either immature technique or financial budget sequestration refref. Heritages from these missions suggest that a waveform lidar system with ~25 m horizontal resolution and ~1 m vertical accuracy, is desired for accurately measuring vertical canopy structure (\\u00b1 10%) in presence of moderate slopes ref. These requirements fit well into current design of GEDI for estimating canopy cover, LAI and FHD.
